# Grocery List

A simple shopping list (built in React JS).

## Part 1: Componentize

Assess the current interface and determine how best to convert it into React Components, such that it will show up looking the same way that it does when run as an HTML-only webpage. Your page does not have to have any functionality yet (but you may consider adding functionality to get ahead on Part 2).

### Hints

- Look for repeating patterns in the HTML
- Components must `return` a single HTML element. So, you may wrap multiple elements in a `<div>` (or similar); Alternatively, you can wrap them in a special React Component called a `<React.Fragment>` (the Fragment docs [can be found here](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html)). Also note there's now also a short-form fragment: `<>`!
